## Installation from source

Create a new conda environment (optional)

```
conda create -n sinaps
```

Install pip and its dependencies

```
conda install pip
```

Change to sinaps directory. This MUST be the parent directory
containing setup.py, not the sinaps subdirectory

```
cd /path/to/sinaps/
```

Install sinaps from source in dev mode

```
pip install -e .
```
